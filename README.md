## Description

**People Organizer**  is a simple yet functional web application that allows users to manage a list of people. It was my very first project using  **JavaScript**,  **HTML**, and  **CSS**, and it represents the beginning of my journey as a web developer.

The application features a basic  **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)**  functionality:

-   **Create**: Add new people to the list by entering their name, last name, age, and country.
    
-   **Read**: View the list of added people.
    
-   **Update**: Edit the details of any person in the list.
    
-   **Delete**: Remove people from the list.
    

While the project is simple, it was a great way to learn core concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic data management.
